3rd party libraries to investigate â€“

Description -
An application that is used to organize school assignments, and keep you on
track to complete assignments. I will be using a GUI as a user interface, a
Date/Time formatter to more easily read dates, a calendar library to more easily
view assignments, and a file upload library to select files related to the
application. A resources that describes how to install and use the library that I
found is https://docs.python.org/3/installing/.
